/* I2S Driver Buffer Event Handler Function

   Summary:
    Pointer to a I2S Driver Buffer Event handler function

    Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the I2S driver
    buffer event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer
    to a buffer event handling function whose function signature (parameter
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive buffer related event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    bufferHandle    - Handle identifying the buffer to which the event relates

    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that registered
                      the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyBufferEventHandler( DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT event,
                                   DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle,
                                   uintptr_t context )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer.
                break;

            case DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

   Remarks:

    If the event is DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE, this means that the data
    was transferred successfully.

    If the event is DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR, this means that the data was
    not transferred successfully. The bufferHandle parameter contains the buffer
    handle of the buffer that failed.  The DRV_I2S_ErrorGet function can be
    called to know the error. The DRV_I2S_BufferProcessedSizeGet function
    can be called to find out how many bytes were processed.

    The bufferHandle parameter contains the buffer handle of the buffer that
    associated with the event.

    The context parameter contains a handle to the client context,
    provided at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_I2S_BufferEventHandlerSet function.  This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the buffer add request.

    The buffer handle in bufferHandle expires after this event handler exits. In
    that the buffer object that was allocated is deallocated by the driver
    after the event handler exits.

    The event handler function executes in the driver peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations with in this function.

    The DRV_I2S_BufferAddRead, DRV_I2S_BufferAddWrite and
    DRV_I2S_BufferAddWriteRead functions can be called in the event handler
    to add a buffer to the driver queue. These functions can only be called
    to add buffers to the driver whose event handler is running. For example,
    buffers cannot be added I2S2 driver in I2S1 driver event handler.

  Summary:
    Initializes hardware and data for the instance of the I2S module.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine initializes the I2S driver instance for the specified driver
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The initialization
    data is specified by the init parameter. The initialization may fail if the
    number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if the specified
    driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance index is
    independent of the I2S module ID. For example, driver instance 0 can be
    assigned to I2S2.  If the driver is built statically, then some of the
    initialization parameters are overridden by configuration macros. Refer to
    the description of the DRV_I2S_INIT data structure for more details on
    which members on this data structure are overridden.

  Precondition:
    If DMA mode of operation is intended, SYS_DMA_Initialize should have been
    called before calling this function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex        - Identifier for the driver instance to be initialized
    init            - Pointer to the data structure containing any data
                      necessary to initialize the hardware. This pointer may
                      be null if no data is required and default
                      initialization is to be used.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise, it returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

Example:
    <code>
    DRV_I2S_INIT              	init;

  Remarks:
    This routine must be called before any other I2S routine is called.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified I2S driver instance and returns a handle to it.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified I2S driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

    The DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING and DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING ioIntent
    options additionally affect the behavior of the DRV_I2S_Read() and
    DRV_I2S_Write() functions. If the ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING,
    then these function will not block even if the required amount of
    data could not be processed. If the ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING,
    these functions will block until the required amount of data is processed.

    If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_READ, the client will only be read from
    the driver. If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE, the client will only be
    able to write to the driver. If the ioIntent in DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE,
    the client will be able to do both, read and write.

    Specifying a DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE will cause the driver to provide
    exclusive access to this client. The driver cannot be opened by any
    other client.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_I2S_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex    - Identifier for the object instance to be opened

    ioIntent    - Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                  DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
                  of the driver. See function description for details.

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. Error can occur
    - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_I2S_CLIENTS_NUMBER is insufficient.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened exclusively by another client.
    - if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is invalid.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;

    handle = DRV_I2S_Open(DRV_I2S_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);
    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
        // May be the driver is not initialized or the initialization
        // is not complete.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_I2S_Close routine is called.
    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware.If the requested intent
    flags are not supported, the routine will return DRV_HANDLE_INVALID.  This
    function is thread safe in a RTOS application. It should not be called in an
    ISR.

  Description:
    This routine closes an opened-instance of the I2S driver, invalidating the
    handle. Any buffers in the driver queue that were submitted by this client
    will be removed.  After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle"
    must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines.  A new handle must

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation. The function returns
    with a valid buffer handle in the bufferHandle argument if the write request
    was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to the hardware
    instance transmit queue and returns immediately. While the request is in the
    queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver and should not be
    modified.  The function returns DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read-only
    - if the buffer size is 0
    - if the queue is full or the queue depth is insufficient
    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver,
    the driver will issue a DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully of DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the
    buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_I2S_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    I2S device instance and the DRV_I2S_Status must have returned
    SYS_STATUS_READY.

    DRV_I2S_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

    DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have been specified in
    the DRV_I2S_Open call.

  Parameters:
    handle       - Handle of the I2S instance as return by the
                   DRV_I2S_Open function
    buffer       - Data to be transmitted
    size         - Buffer size in bytes
    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the
                   return buffer handle

    - if the buffer size is 0
    - if the queue is full or the queue depth is insufficient
    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver,
    the driver will issue a DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully of DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the

  Summary:
    Reads data from the I2S.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine reads data from the I2S. This function is blocking if the
    driver was opened by the client for blocking operation.  This function will
    not block if the driver was opened by the client for non blocking operation.
    If the ioIntent parameter at the time of opening the driver was
    DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING, this function will only return when (or will block
    until) numBytes of bytes have been received or if an error occurred.

    If the ioIntent parameter at the time of opening the driver was
    DRV_IO_INTENT_NON_BLOCKING, this function will return with the number of
    bytes that were actually read. The function will not wait until numBytes of
    bytes have been read.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_I2S_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    I2S driver instance.

    DRV_I2S_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

    DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have been specified in
    the DRV_I2S_Open call.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

    buffer       - Buffer into which the data read from the I2S instance
                   will be placed.

    numBytes     - Total number of bytes that need to be read from the module
                   instance (must be equal to or less than the size of the
                   buffer)

  Returns:
    Number of bytes actually copied into the caller's buffer. Returns
    DRV_I2S_READ_ERROR in case of an error.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE      myI2SHandle;    // Returned from DRV_I2S_Open
    char            myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];

  Summary:
    This function allows a client to identify a buffer event handling function

	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify a buffer event handling function
    for the driver to call back when queued buffer transfers have finished.
    When a client calls either the DRV_I2S_BufferAddRead, DRV_I2S_BufferAddWrite
    or DRV_I2S_BufferAddWriteRead  function, it is provided with a handle
    identifying  the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.  The
    driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler"
    function when the buffer transfer has completed.

    The event handler should be set before the client performs any "buffer add"
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_I2S_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    I2S driver instance.

    DRV_I2S_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine
    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called.  It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle;
